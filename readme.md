# Blorgh Rails Engine

This is a ruby gem which allows developers to add a blogging service to their Rails apps. I made it to learn more about Rails engines' as it helped me make the [Payment Icons](https://github.com/activemerchant/payment_icons) gem for Shopify.

I also made this [sample app](https://github.com/nakulpathak3/app-to-use-blorgh-gem) to see how Rails engines' integrate with Rails apps.

I used http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html as a guide for making this engine.
